# VyAPI - The Modern Cloud-Based Vulnerable Hybrid Android App

![VyAPI Logo](app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/vyapi_main_logo.png)

VyAPI is a vulnerable hybrid Android app that's vulnerable by design. We call it VyAPI, because it's flaws are pervasive and it communicates not just via IPC calls but API calls, too. 

[More details in our introductory blog post](https://blog.appsecco.com/vyapi-the-modern-cloud-based-vulnerable-hybrid-android-app-ee300a9d60ed)

Amazon Cognito has been used to handle authentication, authorization and user management. AWS Amplify Console has been used to consume the Authentication APIs provided by AWS Amplify Authentication module. Room persistence library has been used to handle data in the local SQLite database. Glide API has been used to load images. AndroidX libraries and JAVA programming language have been used to develop the business logic of VyAPI Android app. 

We know how to attack activities, but, what could change with fragments coming into the picture? There might be a case where we just have one activity, but multiple fragments (each rendering a different functionality) in our Android app. VyAPI will allow you to experience this behavior of our modern day Android apps.

VyAPI is different not only in terms of its look and feel, but also in terms of latest technologies being used to build it. Following primary tools and technologies have been used to develop VyAPI
1. [AWS Amplify CLI](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/quickstart)
2. [AWS Mobile SDK for Android 10](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/android/start?ref=amplify-android-btn)
3. [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
4. [OpenJDK 1.8.0_152-release](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
5. [Glide v4](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/)
6. [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/index.html) 
7. [Gradle 5.1.1](https://gradle.org/releases/)

Modern technologies are eliminating security risks by blocking vulnerable features by default. However, not all vulnerabilities could go away that easily. Also, with new technologies come new security vulnerabilities. Security misconfigurations, business logic flaws, and poor coding practices are evergreen vulnerabilities. VyAPI is the vulnerable hybrid Android app which can be used by our security enthusiasts to get a hands-on experience of a variety of modern and legacy Android app vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version `8.11.X` or later)
2. [Amplify CLI](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/)
3. [Android Studio and SDK Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for building the APK)
4. An active [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) with Administrative access
5. [Android emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) (API level 23 or above)

*Note:* 
The commands have been verified in a Linux environment (**Ubuntu 19.04**).

## Installation Steps (Linux)

1. Install [Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli#install-the-cli)<br/>
    ```
    sudo npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli --unsafe-perm=true
    ```
    
    *Note:* `--unsafe-perm=true` is required because of a recent issue with Amplify and [latest version of gyp](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/1996). Ignore errors related to dependencies.

2. Check if **Amplify CLI** was installed successfully
   
    ```
    amplify status
    ```

## Amazon Cognito Setup

1. Checkout the source code from Github
   
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:appsecco/VyAPI.git
   ```

2. Enter the root directory of the cloned project.

   ```
   cd VyAPI/
   ```

3. Run following command to [initialize the project](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/quickstart) to work with the [Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli#install-the-cli)

    ```
    amplify init
    ```

    *Sample Output:*

    ✔ Successfully created initial AWS cloud resources for deployments.
    ✔ Initialized provider successfully.
    Initialized your environment successfully.
    Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!
    Some next steps:
    "amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
    "amplify <category> add" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
    "amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
    "amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud
    Pro tip:
    Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify publish" to deploy everything
    ```

4. Configure [Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli#install-the-cli) by running below command and following the instructions as displayed on the console

    ```
    amplify configure
    ```

    *Sample Output:*
    ```shell
    user@machine:~$ amplify configure
    Follow these steps to set up access to your AWS account:
    Sign in to your AWS administrator account:
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/
    Press Enter to continue
    Specify the AWS Region
    ? region:  us-east-1
    Specify the username of the new IAM user:
    ? user name:  amplify-user
    Complete the user creation using the AWS console
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=undefined#/users$new?step=final&accessKey&userNames=amplify-user&permissionType=policies&policies=arn:aws:iam::aws:policy%2FAdministratorAccess
    Press Enter to continue
    Enter the access key of the newly created user:
    ? accessKeyId:  A**********************
    ? secretAccessKey:  p*************************************
    This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine
    ? Profile Name:  amplify-user
    Successfully set up the new user.
    ```

    *Note:*
    * It requires you to **login** into the **AWS Management Console**. 
    * You need to create a **new user** and obtain the corresponding Access Key ID and Secret Access Key values.
    * If you wish to reuse an existing user, skip the user creation step and press enter to enter the access key of an **existing user**.

5.  Run the following command to add authentication resource in your local backend: 
    ```
    amplify add auth
    ```
    *Sample Output:*
    ```shell
    user@machine:~$ amplify add auth                          
    Using service: Cognito, provided by: awscloudformation
    
        The current configured provider is Amazon Cognito. 
        
        Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
        Warning: you will not be able to edit these selections. 
        How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
        Do you want to configure advanced settings? No, I am done.
        Successfully added resource vyapicbc9b00d locally

        Some next steps:
        "amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
        "amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud
    ```

6. Check the state of local resources not yet pushed to the cloud

    ```
    amplify status
    ```
    
    *Sample Output:*
    ```shell
    user@machine:~$ amplify status
    
    Current Environment: cognito
    | Category | Resource name     | Operation | Provider plugin   |
    | -------- | ----------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
    | Auth     | vyapimvvm59909b03 | Create    | awscloudformation |
    ```


7. Push the local changes to cloud

    ```
    amplify push
    ```

    *Note:* Please be patient while this command runs, as it would take a few minutes to complete.

8. Open the project in Android Studio. 
9.  Generate the VyAPI APK by selecting `Build Bundle(s)/ APK(s)` -> `Build APK(s)` in Android Studio

    ![Build APK](app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/build_apk.jpg)

10. Obtain the VyAPI APK from the relative path `app/release/app-release.apk`

    ![Built APK](app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/built_apk.png)

11. Create an [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds). 
    
    *Note:* The emulator used during the development of VyAPI had following configuration

    ![Android Emulator Configuration](app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/create_android_emulator.png)

12. Install the VyAPI APK (obtained from step #11, above) into the Android Emulator by running the following command

    ```
    adb install app-release.apk
    ```
